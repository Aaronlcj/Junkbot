# Junkbot

An attempt at an open-source version of the original Junkbot and Junkbot Undercover games by Lego on their website circa 2006-2007 or so. This is a C# "port" of the games that were powered by Adobe/Macromedia Shockwave which is now an obsolete format.

Currently this project is very early stages and work is under way ripping all game data from the original DCR files and getting some basic bits of Junkbot to work (level loading, Junkbot movement etc.).

All code in this repo is original but the aim is to get as close to the Shockwave versions as possible.
